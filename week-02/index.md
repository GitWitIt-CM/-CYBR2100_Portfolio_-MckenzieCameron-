# Privacy by Design: Monitoring Policy (Week 2)

## Principles Summary
Notice and consent means users must be informed about monitoring and agree to it through banners or policies before using college systems. Purpose limitation ensures that monitoring is carried out only for authorized reasons such as security, compliance, or investigations. Data minimization means collecting only the information needed to meet those purposes, while proportionality requires that the level of monitoring remain balanced and not excessive. Together, these principles help protect both the College’s operations and individual rights.

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause
Monitoring & Notice 

Hocking College monitors institutional systems and communication channels, including email, Wi-Fi, learning platforms, and college-issued devices to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring is limited to authorized purposes and conducted only by designated staff. Users are notified through login banners and the Acceptable Use Policy. Personal communications are not reviewed except when required by law or during investigations of security or conduct concerns. By using College systems, students and employees acknowledge and consent to this monitoring. 

Data Handling & Retention 

Hocking College collects only the minimum data necessary and restricts access to trained staff. Monitoring data is retained for 90 days unless it is required longer for investigations or legal holds. After this period, data is securely deleted or anonymized. Practices follow principles of data minimization, proportionality, and federal privacy protections such as FERPA. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal through the Office of Information Technology Services or the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Policy violations may result in suspension of access, corrective action, or disciplinary measures consistent with college codes of conduct. 

## Justification
This monitoring policy applies the principles of notice/consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, and proportionality. Users are notified through login banners and the Acceptable Use Policy, and monitoring is restricted to authorized purposes only. Data is limited to what is necessary, retained for 90 days unless legally required longer, and then securely deleted or anonymized. These practices align with Weber’s discussion of privacy and surveillance in Ethics in Technology (Ch. 8), the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), and the FTC’s Start with Security guidance, which stress transparency, limiting collection, and securing data. The policy also cites federal protections such as FERPA, ensuring monitoring respects both institutional needs and individual rights.

## Reflection
If I revised this policy further, I would consider shortening the retention period to less than 90 days and require more frequent reviews of how monitoring data is used. Adding clearer language about the appeals process would also strengthen fairness for students and employees who feel monitoring was applied incorrectly. These adjustments would limit unnecessary risk while still meeting compliance and security needs. The policy impacts many stakeholders: students and employees gain transparency and protection of their rights, while the College maintains accountability and operational security.

## AI Use Note
I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and to clarify definitions of privacy codes/frameworks (FIPPs, FTC *Start with Security*, NIST Privacy Framework).
