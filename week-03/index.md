# Week 03: GPL License & Vulnerablitiy Report

## License Choice
I would choose the **MIT License** because it is simple and permissive. It only requires attribution, works well with both open-source and propietary projects, and avoids the strict copyleft rules of GPL. Apache is similair but adds patent terms that are not relevant here.

**Mitigation**
- Temporary fixes or workarounds

**Timeline**
- Date reported
- Date acknowledged

## Justification
The MIT license is **OSI-approved** and widely used (Open Source Initiative, n.d.). It reduces legal risk, makes collaboration easier, and still ensures the author is credited.

## Reflection
This week I learned how license choice affects adoption and compliance, and how to write a clear vulnerablity report. Next, I would add a **Severity scoring system** for consistency. This helps developers by speeding up fixes and improving trust.

## AI Use Note
I used ChatGPT to help write some of the markdown code for this page, such as formatting the links and evidence section. I also used it clarify techinical terms like copyleft and derivative works.
