# Fall 2025 - Week 1 - Ethics & Law Orientation*

# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical lens
I am leaning on Utilitarianism because it empahsizes outcomes and the greatest good for the greatest number. This fits my approach since I often weigh the imact of choices on different groups. In technology, utilitarian reasoning helps balance benefits and harms in areas like privacy and security.

## Authorization prinicple
Authorization means only accessing resources you have explicit permission for. For example, students may only use campus lab computers for assigned coursework, not for exploring other usersâ€™ files.

## Policy Snippet
Use of the College Lab and Network resources is limited to authorized students, faculty, and staff for approved instructional and research purposes within the assigned scope of coursework or projects. Users must access only the systems and data for which they have explicit permission and must not share credentials, attempt unauthorized access, perform scanning, or data collection outside approved tasks. As emphasized in Ethics in Technology, users are reminded that ethical responsibility extends beyond minimal legal compliance, requiring choices consistent with fairness, respect, and trust. Personal or sensitive data should be minimized and handled responsibly; users may not evade security safeguards or monitoring intended to ensure compliance. By using these resources, users consent to minimal-necessary activity logging. Any suspected misuse, data exposure, or policy concern must be reported immediately to Lab Administrator/IT Helpdesk Contact. Violations may result in suspension of access, disciplinary action under college policies, and/or referral under professional codes such as ACM/IEEE standards. 

## Reflection
I would make the policy example shorter and clearer for students who may not have a tech background. I also want to connect the framework more directly to real-world professional scenarios. This matters because faculty and IT staff are directly impacted by student choices. In future weeks, I will try to be more concise and focused.
