# Week 7 Bioethics & Society Plan

# Lab/Project Ethics Addendum (Final)

## Protocol Approval & Roles
- **Faculty Sponsor:** Responsible for IRB approval, reviewing risks, and protecting participant welfare.  
- **Ethics/Medical Consultation:** Needed for any neural or physiological devices; safety review before launch.  
- **Student Roles:** Students collect and analyze data only with supervision. No testing or device changes without faculty approval.  
- **Device Authorization:** Only approved, non-invasive, and campus-vetted wearable or BCI devices are allowed.  

## Informed Consent
- **Plain-Language Notice:** Explain the purpose, length, and type of data collected (for example, EEG or heart rate).  
- **Risks & Benefits:** Small risks such as discomfort or data exposure compared to possible learning or accessibility benefits.  
- **Voluntary Participation:** Participants can withdraw anytime without penalty.  
- **Consent Format:** Provide both written and digital consent forms with contact information for questions or withdrawal.  

## Scope & Prohibitions
- **No Self-Experimentation Without Oversight:** Faculty must review any personal testing.  
- **No Invasive Devices:** Only surface sensors like EEG caps, wrist wearables, or VR/AR headsets.  
- **No Off-Campus Data Collection:** No third-party or cloud-based trials.  
- **No Enhancement Studies:** Avoid studies that pressure participants to improve performance or compete without clear ethical review.  

## Data Handling
- **Minimum Data Needed:** Collect only what is necessary for the research.  
- **Retention & Deletion:** Keep raw data for up to 30 days and summaries for up to 180 days. Delete and record when done.  
- **Access Control:** Limit access to approved users; use encryption and audit logs.  
- **No Secondary Use:** New consent and IRB review are required before reusing data.  

## Incident & Withdrawal Process
- **Stop-Test Conditions:** Stop testing if someone feels distress, the device fails, or readings become unsafe.  
- **Adverse Events:** Report issues to the faculty sponsor and campus health within 24 hours.  
- **Withdrawal Handling:** Delete or anonymize a participantâ€™s data within seven days and confirm removal.  

## Alignment with Ethical Principles
- **Autonomy & Consent:** Respect voluntary participation and the right to stop.  
- **Beneficence/Non-Maleficence:** Reduce harm and match safety measures to device risks.  
- **Justice & Equity:** Give everyone fair access; offer loaner devices or stipends if needed.

# Equity & Access Analysis
Students with better access to technology could benefit more, while others might be left out. To fix this, the study should offer loaner wearables, travel help, or similar experiences for non-participants. Clear participation rules and open data formats make the project more fair and inclusive.

# Justification
As explained in *Ethics in Technology* (Weber, 2025, Ch. 12), research should protect consent, reduce harm, and promote fairness. These ideas are used here through clear consent, data limits, and safety checks. Chapter 13 reminds us that new technology creates both progress and risk. This study balances learning benefits with privacy and equity protections.

# Reflection
If I revised this plan, I would review how much risk is acceptable for different devices and confirm stronger rules for data deletion. I would also update consent forms to explain secondary data use more clearly. Balancing safety, fairness, and innovation is an ongoing challenge in wearable and neurotech research.
